\section{Data Sources}
After doing some thinking, I've decided that I would rather do something more different from my master's research and fun to me for my data project. So now I am thinking about doing something with MLB data because I love baseball and there is a plethora of MLB data. Sources for this would likely be official MLB website and also baseballreference.com which has a ton of historical baseball data.
